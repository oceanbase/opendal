### Setup LDAP Password

2. Check your email and click the provided link to reset your password.

### Link ASF Account to GitHub

1. Navigate to https://gitbox.apache.org/boxer/ and enter your ApacheID and password.

3. Check your email titled "[GitHub] @asfgit has invited you to join the @apache organization" and accept the invitation.

5. (If you do not enable 2FA on GitHub) Please follow the [instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

Your ApacheID and GitHub ID will now both appear on https://gitbox.apache.org/boxer/. Congrats on successfully linking your ASF account to GitHub!

## Email Settings

If you receive an email with the subject "WELCOME to dev@opendal.apache.org", you have successfully subscribed to the mailing list.

## Setup 1password

OpenDAL offers a 1Password open-source team license for conducting local integration tests (Thanks to 1Password!). Once you have been added to OpenDAL's committer list, one of the PMC members will invite you to join the team.

Please download your preferred clients to begin using it. You can create your own vault that is accessible only by yourself. Neither the 1password team nor OpenDAL PMC members can access it unless you choose to share it.
